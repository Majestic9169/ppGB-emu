### Development Experience

I am experienced with Javascript and frontend frameworks like ReactJS and NextJS. I have built many websites using these frameworks, either alone or collaboratively

- [DAAO.ai](https://daao.ai)
  - Frontend for trading blockchain coins
  - NextJS
- [Livescore](https://github.com/KGP-Speedcubers/live-results/)
  - Website to display live results at unofficial speedcubing competitions
  - Not deployed, I just expose it on the local network when we need it
  - ReactJS

Besides frontend I am comfortabe with Linux and the shell, and have an interest in lower-level systems programming. Here are some related repositories

- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/Majestic9169/koss-selection-task)
  - My (old) configurations for my Arch Linux setup
  - With an accompanying [presentation](https://majestic9169.github.io/koss-selection-task/)
- [Chip-8 Emulator](https://github.com/Majestic9169/chip8)
  - Basic chip8 emulator written in C
  - Custom ROM written in the [Octo IDE](https://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/)

### Other Experiences

I am also involved in Cybersecurity, and often participate in CTF competitions. We recently conducted a CTF workshop you can find [here](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/KOSSCTF-2025/)

### Why this project?

Nintendo games have been a large part of my childhood, I have played many GameBoy Advance games on an emulator. I also have an interest in computer architecture. We use computers so often in our daily life, but can we really say we understand them until we code one?

I also wanted a project that would give me the opportunity to utilise C++ features that we have learnt in our Software Engineering and Systems Programming Lab course.
